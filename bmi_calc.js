Symptoms
<p>Being overweight means that you are carrying too much weight in the form of body fat. Being overweight puts you in the highest weight range, above whatâ€™s 
considered healthy. Being overweight also means your body weight is outside the healthy range.</p>
Cause
<p>Many things can cause weight gain. For most people, obesity happens gradually by taking in more energy than your body needs over time. Foods and drinks 
contain energy (measured in kilojoules), which your body uses, especially during physical activity. The average adult needs 2,000 calories a day for women and 2,500 for men. Any extra energy you consume is stored as body fat.</p>
<p>Other things that can cause weight gain such as your family history (the habits you grew up with and the genes you got from your parents), your surroundings 
(what kinds of food are available and in what portions, and where you work and sleep), your metabolism (how efficiently your body turns food into energy
certain medical conditions that cause weight gain) such as hypothyroidism
certain medicines that cause weight gain as a side effect. 
Stress, low mood, poor-quality sleep, changing emotions, and poor access to healthy food can all cause people to take in more calories than they need. 
</p>
How to Fix it
<p>Some steps that you can take to help reduce the likelihood of obesity :
<ol>
<li>Eat well: Review how many high-energy, low-nutrition snack foods and sugary.
drinks you have, including juice, soft drink, and flavored milk. Consider how often you get takeaway.</li>
<li>Do enough physical activity: Only half of Australians do enough physical activity for good health.
</li>
<li>Limit alcohol: Review how much alcohol you drink (alcohol has many calories with no nutritional benefits).
</li>
